## Administration Menu
The administration menu is your best tool for quickly navigating to the different administration sections of the website.

### Dashboard
The dashboard allows site administrators a nice overview of current site information. You are able to add and remove items from the dashboard. For more information on all the features of the dashboard, please see: 
https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/core/modules/dashboard/working-with-the-dashboard 

### Content
Clicking the content tab gives you access to all content currently on the site (published or unpublished) as well as a link to add new content.

### Structure
The structure tab is where you can configure which content appears in different regions of your site, organize menu links, and manage the different tags and categories of your content. 

### Configuration
The configuration tab will give you the option to update your site’s URL paths and customize the shortcuts toolbar.

### Help
The help tab displays help topics on the various modules enabled on your site. If you have any questions on how a particular module works and what its role is on your site, feel free to contact the Web Manager.

### Shortcuts
The shortcuts tab will allow you to add quick links for different actions. This will be covered in a later topic.

## Static Elements
Certain elements on the site cannot be changed or easily edited. In order for these elements to be updated, you must submit a request to the Web Manager. This does not always guarantee the change will be implemented and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Global Header
The global header contains the College of Engineering logo on larger screens and the University of Kentucky lockup on smaller devices. The header also contains the name of the website. If this needs to be changed or updated, please submit a request.

### Navigation Menu
While the individual menu links can be customized, the main menu is not able to be moved to a different region. On smaller devices this menu will collapse into a dropdown menu with a hamburger menu icon to toggle the menu’s visibility.

### Global Footer
Each site will contain a College of Engineering global footer. Each site does have the ability to create a separate footer which will be covered in a later section.
