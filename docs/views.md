Views are mainly used to create dynamically updated lists of content. There are three main views that are initially available to site administrators:

* home slider
* directory
* news

If youâ€™d like to have a new custom view created, please feel free to [submit a request](https://www.engr.uky.edu/) and one will be built out for you.
