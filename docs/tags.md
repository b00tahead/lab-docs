Tags are a way of classifying content. In Drupal this term is referred to as _taxonomy_. You can create groups of taxonomy terms called _vocabularies_ and then add your own terms to those vocabularies. There are two main vocabularies that are available with each website: **Tags** and **Directory Category**.

> To navigate to the Taxonomy screen, use the administration menu and go to **Structure > Taxonomy**.

## Vocabularies

### Tags
The _Tags_ category is a general purpose taxonomy term. You can add any terms to this group and use it to classify all the content on your site. One of the most common use cases for Tags is to group articles on similar topics into categories. These tags can be used later to create dynamic content such as views that automatically displays content of a selected tag.

### Directory Category
The _Directory Category_ is used to group members of the lab or organization by role on the directory page. For example, you could add a tag for `Director` and a tag for `Graduate Students`. If the directory entries have selected a _Directory Category_ for the _Category_ field, the entries will be grouped into their respective categories.

## Adding a new vocabulary
In order to add a custom vocabulary, from the Taxonomy page, click **Add vocabulary**. Enter a name for the vocabulary and, optionally, a description. This group will now show up on the list of taxonomies.

## Adding a new term
To add a new term to a vocabulary, simply select **add terms** for the vocabulary to which youâ€™d like to add the term. Add a name for the new term and optionally a description. Then click **Save**.
